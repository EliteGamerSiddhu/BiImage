⚠️⚠️THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN ABANDONED⚠️⚠️
I abandoned the project since i could not figure out the use of some bytes of information that seem to be completely useless but is still needed by an image file to be readable by a viewer.

This is a very simple and rough image manipulation library. It supports only .bmp file format.
